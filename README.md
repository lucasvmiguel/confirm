# confirm
Confirm script to run before running something dangerous 

## Install
It's better if you put the confirm file on your bin folder, to be executable everywhere

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucasvmiguel/confirm.git
cd confirm
chmod +x confirm
./confirm && echo 'in case yes write this on the bash'
```
